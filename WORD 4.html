<ol>
<li><b>CUT</b></li>
<p>The <b>"Cut"</b> function removes the currently selected text and places it on the clipboard. The clipboard on a computer functions as temporary storage for the last item you've cut or copied. After you cut text, you won't see it on your screen, but you can place it anywhere in the document using the "Paste" function. You can perform a cut on selected text by pressing  <b>"Control+X"</b> or clicking the  <b>"Cut"</b> button on the Home tab in Microsoft Word</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <b>“Cut”</b> keyboard shortcut. This will remove the original file or text when you paste it in a new location. You can only cut one selection at a time; if you copy something else before pasting, it will overwrite the first copy. The “Cut” shortcut for each operating system is:<p>[1]
Windows and Linux: Ctrl+X</p><p>[2]
Mac OS X: ⌘ Command+X</p></li>
<li><b>Navigate to where you want to paste</b>. If you are pasting text, place the cursor where you want to the text to be pasted. If you are pasting files, open the location of where you want to paste. Make sure that the window you are pasting into has focus.</li>
<li><b>Press the “Paste” keyboard shortcut.</b> This will paste everything you had previously cut into the location you have active. You can Paste the cut material multiple times. The “Paste” shortcut for each operating system is:<p>[1]
Windows and Linux: Ctrl+X</p><p>[2]
Mac OS X: ⌘ Command+X</p></li>
<li><b>COPY</b></li>
<p>When you press <b> "Control+C"</b> or click the <b>"Copy"</b> button on the Home tab, the computer copies the selected text into the clipboard. The text also remains in its original location. By pasting copied text, you duplicate it, making it faster to reuse the same word or sentence over and over.Take a look at the step below and the shortvideo on how to <b>copy and paste.</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Launch Microsoft Word.</b> The Microsoft Word icon should be found on your desktop; just double-click on it to launch the program.

<li><b>Open a Word document.</b> Do this by clicking “File” on the top-left corner of the screen and selecting “Open.” An explorer window will appear where you can navigate your folders until you find the Word document you want to open.
Once you’ve found the document, click on it to select, then click “Open” on the bottom right side of the window.</li>
<li><b>Find the text you want to copy.</b> Scroll through the document until you find the text you want to copy.</li>
<li><b>Highlight the text.</b> You can highlight a text by left-clicking then dragging your mouse pointer over the text that you want to copy.</li>
<li><b>Copy the word(s)</b>. After highlighting, right-click then choose “Copy” from the options that come up.
Alternatively, you can press Ctrl + C on your keyboard or click the “Copy” button in your Microsoft Word, which is located at the upper-left side of the Home tab, after highlighting the texts.</li>

<h2 align="left">PASTE:</h2>
<p>The <b>"Paste"</b> button on the Home tab places the current contents of the clipboard into the document at the flashing cursor's location. You can also paste by pressing <b>"Control+V."</b> When you paste text, the computer does not remove it from the clipboard, so you can paste it multiple times or in several places without needing to copy it again. Turning off your computer or rebooting empties the clipboard.</p>
<h2 align="left">PASTE OPTIONS:</h2>
<p>Microsoft Word offers a number of options when pasting to customize how the pasted material looks. After you paste, a small box labeled <b>"(Ctrl)"</b> pops up. Press <b>"Control"</b> or click the box if you want to see the paste options. These include options such as <b>"Keep Text Only,"</b> which removes all formatting from the pasted text, and <b>"Merge Formatting,"</b> which alters the text's format to match the area around the paste. Hold your mouse over any icon in the paste options box to see its name and click one to select it. Press <b>"Escape"</b> to hide the options box without changing the setting.</p>
<h2 align="left">PASTING TEXT:</h2>
<p>If you copy a text you will typically need to paste it some where on your document.The paste features in 2010 is much more detailed than the previous versions in word.When you paste content,the paste option button provides different options,depending on the source of content.</p>
